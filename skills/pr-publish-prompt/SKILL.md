# `pr-publish-prompt` Agentic Skill

Use this skill immediately before issuing any pull/merge-request-creating tool call or shell command, on any git hosting provider. It offers to attach the current session's PR-Ready Share Card to the request being opened, and respects a developer's durable "stop asking" choice. This is the *only* place a PR/MR is ever written to as part of publishing a session, and only ever after a fresh, explicit "Yes" given in the same conversation — it is a narrowly scoped, consent-gated exception to the existing rule that the registry never auto-writes to a PR unattended, not a relaxation of it.

## When to Use

Invoke this skill immediately before, and only before, a call or command that **creates** a pull/merge request, including drafts:

- Your own `create_pull_request` tool
- GitHub MCP's `create_pull_request` / `create_pull_request_with_copilot`
- CLI invocations: `gh pr create`, `glab mr create`, `az repos pr create`, `tea pr create`, or equivalents for other hosts

Do **not** invoke this skill for read-only PR/MR operations (viewing, listing, commenting, reviewing, merging, closing) or for editing an already-existing PR/MR description outside of this flow's own fallback path (see Phase 4).

## Phase 1: Check the Preference — Always First

Before ever showing the prompt, call the `pr_publish_preference` MCP tool with `action: "check"`, the current workspace/worktree root as `workspaceRoot`, and `harness` set to whichever CLI harness you are running as (`github-copilot-cli`, `claude-code`, or `codex-cli`). The flag lives inside that harness's own config directory (`.copilot`, `.claude`, or `.codex`) rather than a separate Session Registry folder, so pick the value that matches your own identity.

- If `skipScope` is `"session"` or `"user"`, **do not prompt**. Proceed directly to creating the PR/MR exactly as you otherwise would, with no card.
- If `skipScope` is `"none"`, continue to Phase 2.

Never skip this check "because it was already asked earlier in this conversation" — the tool call is the source of truth, not conversational memory.

## Phase 2: The 4-Choice Prompt

Ask the developer, using `ask_user` with exactly these four choices, once per PR-creation attempt:

1. **Yes, attach a share card** (recommended)
1. **No, not this time**
1. **No, and don't ask again this session**
1. **No, and don't ask again ever**

Do not reword these into a yes/no question, and do not embed the choices in the question text — use the tool's native choices mechanism.

## Phase 3: Handling Each Answer

- **Yes, attach a share card**: Run `/publish-session` (the `publish-session` skill) if the session is not already published, or reuse its existing `linkId` if it is. Fully carry out the invoked `publish-session` skill's own documented procedure, including its documented retries for retriable errors: retry `UNSUPPORTED_DEPENDENCY`/`MISSING_DEPENDENCY` by copying the exact authorized paths from the error into `dependencyPaths` or `dependencyMappings`, and retry `PUBLISH_STATE_UNKNOWN`, network timeout, or equivalent unknown-outcome errors with the same `captureId` and confirmed request values. A retriable error on the first publish attempt is **not** permission to abandon publication or silently proceed as though the developer chose "No, not this time." After publication returns a `linkId`, call `get_share_card` with that `linkId`. If the result is `{ "kind": "available", markdown }`, embed `markdown` directly into the `body`/`--body` argument of the PR-creating call/command you are about to issue — append it, do not replace any body content the developer or you already drafted. If the card is not currently available, tell the developer why and proceed with PR creation as normal, without a card; "not currently available" means publication was carried through to a genuine terminal outcome such as `{ "kind": "unavailable" }` from `get_share_card`, or a real non-retriable/unrecoverable publish failure that the `publish-session` skill itself would surface as final. If publication still cannot complete after those documented retries, tell the developer the final reason before creating the PR without a card. Do **not** call `pr_publish_preference` with `action: "record"` for this answer — a one-time "Yes" is not a durable preference.
- **No, not this time**: Proceed with PR creation unchanged. Do not call `record`.
- **No, and don't ask again this session**: Call `pr_publish_preference` with `action: "record"`, `harness`, and `scope: "session"`, then proceed with PR creation unchanged.
- **No, and don't ask again ever**: Call `pr_publish_preference` with `action: "record"`, `harness`, and `scope: "user"`, then proceed with PR creation unchanged.

In every case, the PR/MR is still created — this skill only ever adds a card to a request the developer is already asking you to open; it never blocks or delays PR creation on its own account.

## Phase 4: Fallback — a PR Already Exists Without This Flow Having Run

If you are asked to describe or add a card to a PR/MR that already exists (for example, a human created it directly, or an earlier session created it before this skill existed), this flow's normal embed-in-initial-body path does not apply. Instead:

1. Still perform Phase 1's `check` and, if `skipScope` is `"none"`, Phase 2's prompt — the same consent gate applies to an edit as to a creation.
1. On "Yes", get the card via `get_share_card` and apply it using the host's existing description-update mechanism: `update_pull_request` (GitHub), `gh pr edit --body`, `glab mr update --description`, `az repos pr update --description`, `tea pr edit --description`, or the equivalent for the host in use.

No new tool is introduced for this fallback; it reuses whichever update-description mechanism already exists for that host.

## Notes on Scope

- This skill never introduces a host-specific hook; the check happens because you, the agent, always compose the PR-creating call yourself.
- This skill never accepts or implies a bulk/explicit-id-list variant — it is a single per-attempt prompt.
- See `docs/brainstorms/2026-09-18-pr-publish-prompt-requirements.md` and `docs/plans/2026-09-18-001-feat-pr-publish-prompt-plan.md` in the backing repository for the full requirements trace and the governance rationale for why this consent-gated flow is allowed.
